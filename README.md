# Texts in images, or speech in audios?

This mod solves the translation problem of image and audio assets by dynamically sending the appropriate one to the client. Documentations are generated using [`ldoc`](https://lunarmodules.github.io/ldoc/manual/manual.md.html) in `doc/`, or alternatively inside `init.lua`.
